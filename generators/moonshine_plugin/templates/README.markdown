## Introduction

Welcome to Moonshine::<%= module_name %>, a [Moonshine](http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine) plugin for installing and managing [<%= name %>](http://www.google.com/search?q=<%= name %>)

 * [Wiki](http://github.com/ACCOUNT/moonshine_<%= name %>/wiki)
 * [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com)
 * Resources for using <%= module_name %>:
   * [<%= module_name %> Homepage](http://www.google.com/search?q=<%= name %>)

## Quick Start

Moonshine::<%= module_name %> is installed as a Rails plugin:

    # Rails 2.x.x
    script/plugin install git://github.com/ACCOUNT/moonshine_<%= name %>.git
    # Rails 3.x.x
    script/rails plugin install git://github.com/ACCOUNT/moonshine_<%= name %>.git

Once it's installed, you can include it in your manifest:

    # app/manifests/application_manifest.rb
    class ApplicationManifest < Moonshine::Manifest:Rails

       # other recipes and configuration omitted

       # tell ApplicationManifest to use the <%= name %> recipe
       recipe :<%= name %>
    end

Ideally, things should work out of the box. If not, be sure to make the code detects missing configuration and fails with instructions. Also, include details about any required settings here.

## Configuration Options

Here's some other <%= name %> configuration options you may be interested in.

 * `:degrees`: an integer representing the degree of <%= name %>

These are namespaced under `:<%= name %>`. They can be configured a few ways:

    # in global config/moonshine.yml
    :<%= name %>:
      :degrees: 10000

    # in stage-specific moonshine.yml,
    # config/moonshine/staging.yml and config/moonshine/production.yml
    :<%= name %>:
      :degrees: 10000

    # `configure` call in app/manifests/application_manifest.rb
    configure :<%= name %> => { :degrees => 10000 }
