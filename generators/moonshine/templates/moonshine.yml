# config/moonshine.yml is loaded both by capistrano and moonshine.
#  The result is the values defined here can be used in `config/deploy.rb` directly
#  and in `app/manifest/<%=  file_name%>.rb` via `configuration`

# ruby to install at `cap deploy:setup` time. If you change this value, you
# need to run `cap ruby:upgrade`.
#
# As of time of generating, these are valid values:
# * mri (as installed by Ubuntu)
# * src193
# * src193falcon - This is p327 + falcon patch and provides some serious performance benefits compared to stock 1.9.3.
# * src193railsexpress - This is p448 + the railsexpress patches and in early testing is even faster than just the falcon patch.
# * src200
# * src200railsexpress - This is Ruby 2.0.0 + the railsexpress patches.
# * src21
# * src21railsexpress - This is Ruby 2.1 + the railsexpress patches.
# * src22
# * src23
